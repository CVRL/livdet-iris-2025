### Summary

LivDet-Iris 2025 serves as the sixth edition of the iris liveness detection competition in the LivDet-Iris series. Held every two to three years, the competition aims to foster the development of robust algorithms capable of detecting a wide range of physically- and digitally-presented attacks in iris biometrics. The 2025 edition obtained the largest number of submissions in the history of the competition: ten algorithms from five institutions, and one commercial iris recognition system.

### Competition Tasks

- **Part 1 (Algorithms)** involves the evaluation of the software solutions (submitted to the organizers) in three tasks, in which large datasets of iris images representing bona fide samples and various anomalies were used:
  
	- **Task 1: Industry Partner's Tests:** The industry partner, PayEye, Poland, evaluated all submissions using a sequestered dataset that reflects the most prevalent physical attacks observed in real-world iris recognition-based payment services. The presentation attack instruments (PAIs) included in this task are paper printouts, irises displayed on an e-book reader, artificial eyes, doll eyes, mannequin eyes, as well as samples synthesized using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs);
	- **Task 2: Deep Learning-Aided Iris Morphing:** Submissions were tested against morphed iris samples, prepared by compositing two iris images representing two identities, with the seams caused by the compositing process "smoothed" by a diffusion model to increase the visual realism of such morphed samples;
	- **Task 3: Robustness to Advanced Textured Contact Lens (TCL) Manufacturing:** focused on assessing the robustness of liveness detection methods against modern manufacturing techniques used to produce TCL brands, including high-resolution printing, multi-layered designs, and improved pigmentation. This task allowed to assess how well current methods can detect these next-generation lenses and examine the community's readiness in addressing this evolving threat.
- **Part 2 (Systems)** involves the systematic testing of submitted iris recognition systems based on physical artifacts presented to the sensors by a laboratory staff.

### Datasets

Instructions on how to obtain a copy of test data used in Task 2 can be found at the [Notre Dame's Computer Vision Research Lab webpage](https://cvrl.nd.edu/projects/data/) (search for ``LivDet-Iris 2025 Task 2`` dataset).

**Note:** the dataset will be added to the CVRL webpage after the LivDet-Iris paper is accepted.

To obtain a copy of the test data used in Task 3, you may contact livdet@gmail.com to request the release agreement.
The dataset consists of 564 bona fide iris images and 788 presentation attack samples collected from 7 subjects wearing textured contact lenses. These attack samples represent nine different contact lens brands and are categorized into two quality classes: High Quality and Pixelated. Specifically, 644 high-quality samples originate from six different contact lenses, while the remaining 144 pixelated samples are from three other contact lenses.
